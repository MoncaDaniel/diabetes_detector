# Model Details

## Model Architecture
This project utilizes a **stacking ensemble model** to predict diabetes risk, combining the strengths of several classifiers to improve accuracy and robustness. The ensemble model is composed of the following algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that serves as a strong baseline and handles linear relationships well.
2. **Decision Tree**: A non-linear model that captures complex interactions and is sensitive to specific data patterns.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by reducing overfitting through bagging.
4. **Gradient Boosting**: A sequential ensemble model that optimizes accuracy by focusing on the mistakes of previous models.

The stacking model combines predictions from each of these base models through a meta-learner (Logistic Regression), which produces the final prediction.

### Model Hyperparameters
Each model within the ensemble was fine-tuned through cross-validation to optimize performance on the dataset. The final hyperparameters for each model are as follows:

- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Regularization (`C`): 1.0
  - Solver: 'liblinear'

- **Decision Tree**:
  - Max Depth: 8
  - Min Samples Split: 10

- **Random Forest**:
  - Number of Estimators: 100
  - Max Features: 'sqrt'

- **Gradient Boosting**:
  - Number of Estimators: 150
  - Learning Rate: 0.1
  - Max Depth: 3

The meta-learner (Logistic Regression) uses a regularization parameter (`C`) of 1.0 to balance the contribution of each base model’s predictions.

### Training Process
The model was trained using an 80-20 train-test split, with additional validation through 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance. Below is an overview of the training steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The preprocessed dataset was split into training and test sets.
   - The synthetic **GeneticPredisposition** feature was incorporated to improve accuracy.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Each base model in the ensemble was trained independently on the training set, using cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
   - The predictions from each base model were then combined as inputs to the meta-learner (Logistic Regression).
   
3. **Cross-Validation**:
   - 5-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate each model’s performance consistently.
   - This process helped identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues, allowing for hyperparameter adjustments.

4. **Stacking Ensemble**:
   - Predictions from each base model were passed to the meta-learner to produce the final prediction.
   - The stacking approach improved the model's generalizability by leveraging the strengths of each base model.

### Evaluation Metrics
The ensemble model was evaluated using multiple metrics to ensure balanced performance across both classes (non-diabetes and diabetes). The following metrics were used:

- **Accuracy**: 0.8394
- **Precision**: 0.84
- **Recall**: 0.84
- **F1 Score**: 0.84

These metrics indicate that the model performs well in identifying diabetes cases, with a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.

### Model Selection Rationale
The stacking ensemble was selected for its ability to integrate diverse learning patterns. Here’s why each component was chosen:

- **Logistic Regression**: Provides a stable baseline and interpretable results, useful for linear relationships in the data.
- **Decision Tree**: Handles non-linear relationships, especially useful for capturing interactions between health indicators.
- **Random Forest**: Reduces variance and improves robustness through bagging, mitigating overfitting.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Focuses on difficult cases in the data, optimizing accuracy by adjusting for errors.

### Model Deployment
The trained stacking ensemble model was saved using the `joblib` library, facilitating easy deployment in production. The file `stacking_model.joblib` contains the complete trained model, ready for loading and use in the UI application.

### Future Improvements
Potential improvements to the model include:
- **Additional Features**: Incorporating socio-economic or lifestyle factors for better predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Exploring advanced optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization for even finer hyperparameter tuning.
- **Deep Learning**: Experimenting with neural network architectures on larger datasets to capture more complex patterns.
